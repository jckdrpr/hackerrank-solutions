 - Bunnies are very cute animals who likes to jump a lot. Every bunny has his own range of jump.
 - Lets say there are N bunnies and ith  bunny jumps j_i units. Consider a 1-D plane, where
 - initially bunnies are at 0. All of them starts jumping in forward direction.
 - 
 - For example, kth consider the case of 0 bunny. Initially he is at j_k. After first jump, he
 - will be at point j_k. After second, he will be at 2* j_k and so on. After m jump, he will be at
 - point m * j_k .
 - 
 - Two bunnies can only meet each other when they are on the ground. When on the ground, a bunny
 - can wait any amount of time. Being a social animal, all of them decide to meet at the next
 - point where all of them will be on the ground. You have to find the nearest point where all the
 - bunnies can meet.
 - 
 - For example, if there are N = 3 bunnies where j_1 = 2, j_2 = 3, j_3 = 4. Nearest point where
 - all bunnies can meet again is at 12. First bunny has to jump six times, for second it is 4 times
 - and for third it is 3 times.
 - 
 - Help bunnies to find the nearest point where they can meet again.

 - Scturtle likes strings very much. He is getting bored today, because he has already completed
 - this week's task and doesn't have anything else to do. So he starts left-rotating a string. If
 - the length of the string is n, then he will rotate it n times and note down the result of each
 - rotation on a paper. 
 - 
 - For a string S = s1,...sn, n rotations are possible. Let's represent these rotations by r1..rn.
 - Rotating it once will result in string r1 = s2s3...sns1, rotating it again will result in string
 - r2 = s3s4...sns1s2 and so on. Formally, i rotation will be equal to ri = s{i+1}...s{n-1}sns1..si.
 - Note that rn = S.
 - 
 - Your task is to display all n rotations of string S.
 - 
 - For example, if S = abc then it has 3 rotations. They are r1 = bca, r2 = cab and r3 = abc.

 - Sometimes you need to compare lists of number, but sorting each one normally will take too much
 - time. Instead you can use alternative methods to find the differences between each list.
 - 
 - Challenge:
 - Numeros The Artist was arranging two identical lists A and B into specific orders. The
 - arrangements of the two arrays were random, Numeros was very proud of his arrangements.
 - Unfortunately, some numbers got left out of List A. Can you find the missing numbers from A
 - without messing up his order?
 - 
 - Details:
 - There are many duplicates in the lists, but you need to find the extra numbers, i.e. B - A.
 - Print the numbers in numerical order. Print each missing number once, even if it is missing
 - multiple times. The numbers are all within a range of 100 from each other.
